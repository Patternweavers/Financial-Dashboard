## Project: Income and Expense Analysis Report

This repository contains a Power BI report designed to analyze and compare income and expenses. The report provides a comprehensive view of financial performance, budget adherence, and key performance indicators. It's intended to showcase data analysis, visualization, and reporting skills within the Power BI environment.

**Report Overview**

The report is structured to provide insights into the following:

* **Income and Expense Comparison:** A high-level overview of actual income and expenses against their respective budgets.
* **Trend Analysis:** Visualizations showing how income and expenses have varied over time (by year).
* **Detailed Breakdown:** Tabular data providing a detailed look at income and expenses for individual projects or IDs.

**Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) Highlighted:**

* **Income Actual:** The actual income earned.
* **Income Budget:** The budgeted income.
* **Income Variance %:** The percentage difference between actual and budgeted income.
* **Income Ratio:** The ratio of actual income to budgeted income.
* **Expense Actual:** The actual expenses incurred.
* **Expense Budget:** The budgeted expenses.
* **Expense Variance %:** The percentage difference between actual and budgeted expenses.
* **Utilization Ratio:** The ratio of actual expenses to budgeted expenses.

**Technical Details**

* **Tool:** Microsoft Power BI
* **Data Source:** The repository includes a sample dataset (e.g., `financial_data.xlsx` or `financial_data.csv`) that was used to create the report. The data includes fields such as:
    * Project ID
    * Year

**Demonstrated Skills**

This project demonstrates proficiency in:

* **Data Loading and Transformation (ETL):** (Implied within the .pbix file)
* **Data Modeling:** Creating relationships and measures within Power BI.
* **DAX Calculations:** Using DAX to create calculated columns, measures, and KPIs (e.g., Variance %, Ratios).
* **Data Visualization:** Designing effective and informative visualizations, including:
    * Bar charts
    * Tables
    * KPI cards
* **Interactive Reporting:** Creating a user-friendly report with filters (Year, Month, Project ID).
* **Financial Reporting:** Applying business intelligence techniques to a financial analysis context.

**How to Use This Report**

1.  **Software:** Ensure you have Microsoft Power BI Desktop installed.
2.  **Download:** Download the following files from this repository:
    * `Income and Expense Analysis.pbix`
    * `financial_data.xlsx` / `financial_data.csv`
3.  **Open:** Open the `Income and Expense Analysis.pbix` file in Power BI Desktop.
4.  **Explore:** Interact with the report:
    * Use the filters at the top of the report page (Year, Month, Project ID) to analyze specific periods or projects.
    * Review the visualizations to understand income and expense trends.
    * Examine the tables for detailed data.

**Key Insights (Based on Sample Data)**

Based on the sample data, some potential insights include:

* [Example: Overall, income is generally close to budget, but there are some monthly fluctuations.]
* [Example: Project ID 1050 consistently shows a positive income variance.]
* [Example: Expenses are slightly below budget, which is favorable, but it's important to analyze if this is due to efficiency or under-spending in critical areas.]

**Important Notes**

* The data provided in this repository is sample data for demonstration purposes.  It may not reflect real-world financial data with complete accuracy.
* The primary purpose of this repository is to showcase Power BI skills and financial reporting capabilities.
